mcserver_scripts
================

my minecraft(craftbukkit) server scripts

grep files for `##($RECONFIG)` for any files that need to be changed for per-server/path dependant. comments should explain more.


note that we use screen (look up converting to tmux) so here is the layout of the screen session:

0. this server/main server
1. blank terminal or sub-server (adventure server?)
2. bash
3. bash
4. bash shell in the correct location to execute the render.scc command
5. bash
6. htop
